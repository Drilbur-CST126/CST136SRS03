Notes:

For the value of "Value" in the table, that is the value of one dollar in that currency in US dollars. (EX: For Australia, 0.76 is 0.75 US / AU)

To convert from one currency CA to another currency CB, the equation is x * val(CA) / val(CB)

The desired syntax is templateA< CB, templateB<CA, x>> and converts it to the standard; templateB converts to standard && templateA converts from standard

Example case: 1.23 AU == 1.32 NZ
